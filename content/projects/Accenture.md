In Accenture, I am placed on the critical client to be an SME/Dev Lead. I am the one in charge of making sure that each requirement by the clients are met and make sure that all roadblocks encountered by the developers are cleared. Aside from managing a team, I am also expected to provide development work. In Accenture, I was assigned to diverse and complex projects that use different technologies from SharePoint (2010,2013 and SPO), Azure, Sitecore, and Orckestra(CMS). During my stay in Accenture, I am fortunate enough to receive 3 client awards from 3 different projects I handled.
