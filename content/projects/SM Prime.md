SM Prime is the largest retail company in the Philippines, I was initially assigned as a SharePoint Administrator. Aside from Administrating the server (SharePoint 2010), I am also expected to provide full support to the users making sure that all their problem/question/concern about SharePoint is answered. Since I have the greatest number of experiences to SharePoint to the company I am also assigned to act as a Dev Lead to the Dev Team making sure that the team is following all best practices and providing them SME advice if they encountered any challenges in customizing SharePoint.
