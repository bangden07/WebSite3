Sytek is a service provider to more than 30 clients here in BC. I was solely assigned to handle all the helpdesk tickets to their biggest clients with an average of 25 tickets a day. Since Systek is moving from service provider to solution provider company I am also now allocated to developed new application for the client using PHP(Laravel) that enables client download pdf building report.
