In Medcall I was assigned to as a SharePoint Support Specialist. As a SharePoint Support Specialist, I am expected to provide support to all employees who use SharePoint. Before I came into the company they only use SharePoint 2007 as a document repository, so I made an initiative to developed an application in SharePoint that utilize Javascript and workflows to automate one of the most tedious processes of the company. This opens the door of opportunity to the SharePoint team that made the other departments request their task to be automated as well in SharePoint.
